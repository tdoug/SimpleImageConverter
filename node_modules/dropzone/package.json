  "readme": "<h1 align=\"center\">\n  <img alt=\"Dropzone.js\" src=\"http://www.dropzonejs.com/images/logo.png\" />\n</h1>\n\n*Version 3.8.4*\n\nDropzone.js is a light weight JavaScript library that turns an HTML element into a dropzone.\nThis means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and the file gets uploaded to the server via AJAX.\n\n> **Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start working on Dropzone!**\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/releases/latest\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/enyo/dropzone/master/download.png\" alt=\"Download\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\nStarting with version 2.0.0 this library does no longer depend on jQuery (but\nit still works as a jQuery module).\n\nIt is written as a [component](https://github.com/component/component) but\nthere's a standalone version, and an [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)\nmodule that's compatible with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) in the downloads\nfolder.\n\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/zXyTjMp.png)\n\n\nMaster  \n![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/enyo/dropzone.png?branch=master)  \n\n\n## Main features\n\n- Image thumbnail previews. Simply register the callback `thumbnail(file, data)` and display the image wherever you like\n- Multiple files and synchronous uploads\n- Progress updates\n- Support for large files\n- Well tested\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor the full documentation and installation please visit www.dropzonejs.com\n\nPlease also refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki/FAQ).\n\n## Examples\n\nFor examples, please see the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki).\n\n## Usage\n\nImplicit creation:\n\n```html\n<form id=\"my-awesome-dropzone\" action=\"/target\" class=\"dropzone\"></form>\n```\n\nThat's it. Really!\n\nDropzone will automatically attach to it, and handle file drops.\n\nWant more control? You can configure dropzones like this:\n\n```js\n// \"myAwesomeDropzone\" is the camelized version of the ID of your HTML element\nDropzone.options.myAwesomeDropzone = { maxFilesize: 1 };\n```\n\n...or instantiate dropzone manually like this:\n\n```js\nnew Dropzone(\"div#my-dropzone\", { /* options */ });\n```\n\n> Note that dropzones don't have to be forms. But if you choose another element you have to pass the `url` parameter in the options.\n\nFor configuration options please look at the [documentation on the website](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration)\nor at the [source](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/master/src/dropzone.coffee#L90).\n\n\n\n### Register for events\n\nI use [emitter](https://github.com/component/emitter) to manage events. If you want to register to some event you can do so on the `dropzone` object itself:\n\n```js\nDropzone.options.myDropzone({\n  init: function() {\n    this.on(\"error\", function(file, message) { alert(message); });\n  }\n});\n// or if you need to access a Dropzone somewhere else:\nvar myDropzone = Dropzone.forElement(\"div#my-dropzone\");\nmyDropzone.on(\"error\", function(file, message) { alert(message); });\n```\n\nFor a list of all events, please look at the chapter \n[»listen to events«](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#listen_to_events) in the documentation\nor at the [source](src/dropzone.coffee#L43).\n\n\n## Browser support\n\n- Chrome 7+\n- Firefox 4+\n- IE 10+\n- Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy)\n- Safari 6+\n\nFor all the other browsers, dropzone provides an oldschool file input fallback.\n\n## Why another library?\n\nI realize that there [are](http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) [already](http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/) [other](http://code.google.com/p/html5uploader/) [libraries](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/) out there but the reason I decided to write my own are the following:\n\n- I didn't want it to be too big, and to cumbersome to dive into.\n- I want to design my own elements. I only want to register callbacks so I can update my elements accordingly.\n- Big files should get uploaded without a problem.\n- I wanted a callback for image previews, that don't kill the browser if too many too big images are viewed.\n- I want to use the latest API of browsers. I don't care if it falls back to the normal upload form if the browser is too old.\n- I don't think that it's necessary anymore to depend on libraries such as jQuery (especially when providing functionality that isn't available in old browsers anyway).\n\n## Other projects\n\nYou might also be interested in my [open source tooltip library Opentip](http://www.opentip.org/).\n![Opentip](http://i.imgur.com/Zubpo.png)\n\nLicense\n-------\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Matias Meno &lt;m@tias.me&gt;<br>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
